    <h1>Why Door 12 OS is better than Windows 10 OS (Our prime competitor)</h1>
    <h2>🚪 Windows are not mandatory. But doors are a must</h2>
    <h2>👨‍🔬 12 is greater than 10. Ask javascript if you dont believe me</h2>
    <h2>🔮 We allow you to change the background color!</h2>
    <h2>🗺 Our "Dora the explorer" can explore better than "File Explorer"</h2>
    <h2>🔗 In Quick access, We have a link to google where you can search for anything. In Windows thats not the case
    </h2>
    <h2>🙂The files have face, hands and legs</h2>
    <h2>🕺 The happy files hop when you touch it</h2>
    <h2>🛠 We have a huge selection of tools to help you(Da Fridge, Boxing ring, Paintings, B news, etc.)</h2>
    <h2>🤦‍♂️ We call your computer as "your computer" unlike our prime competitor. they call it "my computer"</h2>
